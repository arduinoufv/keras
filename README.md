## Lab 1 
[Keras Code Sample: Image classification from scratch](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MrVHG5B0xJB83G4hz8fSfgBCn7PwHAoh?usp=sharing)
* Training an image classifier from scratch on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset
* 23410 images 180x180, data processing and augmentation
* Small version of the [Xception network, 2016, Francois Chollet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)
* We get to ~96% validation accuracy after training for 50 epochs on the full dataset.
* 209s√ó50 epoches =10450s=174min10s=3 hours.
* What's new ? Exercises, pre-saved training, Q&A, ...

### About LSTMs
The CNN Long Short-Term Memory Network or CNN LSTM for short is an LSTM architecture specifically designed for sequence prediction problems with spatial inputs, like images or videos.
