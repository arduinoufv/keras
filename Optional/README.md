# Keras Examples

1. [OCR model for reading Captchas](https://keras.io/examples/vision/captcha_ocr/)
This example demonstrates a simple OCR model built with the Functional API. 
Apart from combining CNN and RNN, it also illustrates how you can instantiate
a new layer and use it as an "Endpoint layer" for implementing CTC loss
